## LSAS (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale)

This repo contains two versions of the LSAS:
- child/adolescent self-report
- parent version (in English and Spanish for Latin America (_ES))

For each version, the repo includes a .pdf or .docx file, as well as the REDCap import .zip and survey PDF.

Both versions are built into a single data dictionary, as they are often presented concurrently to an adolescent participant and their parent/guardian.


### Scoring Script
Both versions of the LSAS are included in the repository scoring script. The English and Spanish versions of the parent form are scored identically.  Threshold for scoring is 100%.
