## BRIEF-A
The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version (BRIEF-A) is not publicly available and we are in the process of obtaining a complete copy of the measure from the publisher. The two files available in this repository are:
* a detailed description of the BRIEF-A, to include a description of all subscales and example items
* a complete copy of the closely related BRIEF-2 questionnaire.


### Scoring Script
The BRIEF-A is **not** included in the repository scoring script.
