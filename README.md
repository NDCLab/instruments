# instruments

## Project Goal
A home for all surveys, questionnaires, and inventories used by the NDCLab, with an automatic scoring script.


## Background & Design
Each instrument used by the lab exists in the repo as a folder, containing (as applicable):
* the published instrument (in English and any other languages used for lab research)
* a REDCap import .zip for the instrument
* any translations completed by the NDCLab

Additionally, this repo holds the scoring script for all scorable instruments.


## Roadmap
As of July 2021, we are working on the initial release of the scoring script, which will include the instruments used in the three inaugural studies of the NDCLab at FIU: social-context-alpha, missing-link-alpha, and rwe-alpha.


## Usage
Replace this text with a description of how a new user should install and use the tool.
