## THQ (Trauma History Questionnaire)

This repo contains the main PDF, REDCap import .zip, and REDCap survey PDF for the THQ questionnaire.  Given the sensitive nature of these questions, special care must be taken in its administration and the NDCLab uses additional information in the survey header to point study participants to mental health resources in the event that they become distressed when reflecting upon their past traumatic experiences.

### thq_b
This version of the questionnaire drops all "Number of times/Repeated?" and "Please specify" sub-questions. As such, only the main question and the "Approximate age(s)" sub-question remain for each item. To simplify the output file, the age question was renamed to "iX_age."

### thq(_a)
This is the original, complete questionnaire. 


### Scoring Script
The THQ questionnaire is **not** included in the repository scoring script.
